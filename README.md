# Integrative functional logistic regression model for genome-wide association studies （IFLR）
When the dimensionality of SNP data is large, identifying a signiffcant number of genetic variants associated with diseases becomes extremely challenging. To address these
high-dimensionality issues, we employed functional data analysis techniques. We conducted association analysis between discrete phenotype and functional data.
